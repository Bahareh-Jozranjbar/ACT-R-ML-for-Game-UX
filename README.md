# ACT-R and Machine Learning for UX Research

## Predicting Cognitive Performance with ACT-R and Machine Learning

This project explores how cognitive modeling with ACT-R can enhance UX research by making it more predictive. Instead of just analyzing past user behavior, this approach models cognitive processes like perception, memory, and decision-making to predict performance in real time. By integrating machine learning, we can make smarter UX decisions faster.

## What This Project Does

- **Simulates user cognition** using ACT-R principles
- **Uses machine learning (Random Forest)** to predict reaction times
- **Analyzes cognitive load** and its impact on user performance
- **Generates presentation-ready plots** with a transparent background for UX reports
- **Improves decision-making in UX research** by making it more proactive

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required R libraries (`ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `randomForest`, `caret`).
3. Run the R script to simulate data and generate visualizations.
4. Use the generated plots for UX insights and presentations.

## Visualizations

The code generates the following visualizations:

- **Feature Importance Plot:** Shows which cognitive factors impact reaction time the most.
- **Cognitive Load vs. Reaction Time Scatterplot:** Illustrates the effect of cognitive load on response speed.
- **Reaction Time Distribution Histogram:** Highlights variability in user performance.
- **Error Rate Pie Chart:** Predicts and visualizes common user mistakes.
